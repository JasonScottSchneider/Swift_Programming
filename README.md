# Swift_Programming
This is just a bunch of random stuff I am playing around with as I pick up the Swift programming language. I am using Swift in Linux, but it should work in both Mac and Linux, ... maybe.
The "test2" file is an executable that can be run in the terminal, maybe command prompt for Win users, by typing cd test2 in the terminal followed by typing  .build/debug/test2 where the executable is located. It should print "Jason rocks!" in the terminal. I know. This is lame, but I am just playing around with learning how to create libraries and executables with Swift, which I am finding Swift to be a fun language, even though I cannot do as much with it in Linux as I can in Mac with XCode.
I am still exploring how the package manager works and how I can trim this down, but, for now, I am giving the whole shebang here for my executable demo.
