# Swift_Programming
This is just a bunch of random stuff I am playing around with as I pick up the Swift programming language. I am using Swift in Linux, but it should work in both Mac and Linux, ... maybe.
The "test2" file is an executable that can be run in the terminal, maybe command prompt for Win users, by typing test2 where it is located. It should print "Jason rocks!" in the terminal. I know. This is lame, but I am just playing around with learning how to create libraries and executables with Swift, which I am finding Swift to be a fun language, even though I cannot do as much with it in Linux as I can in Mac with XCode.
